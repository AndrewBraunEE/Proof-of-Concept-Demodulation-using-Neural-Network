# EE132A-Project-Neural-Network-Receiver-Demodulator
This is the project solution for Winter 2019 for Communication Systems at UCLA under Professor Suhas Diggavi 

The Neural Network Decoder can be found at: https://github.com/AndrewBraunEE/Proof-of-Concept-Demodulation-using-Neural-Network/blob/master/app/Neural_Network/__main__.py

We provide documentation of our results in https://github.com/AndrewBraunEE/Proof-of-Concept-Demodulation-using-Neural-Network/blob/master/EE132A_Project_Report_Final.pdf . Reproducing and running the script is also documented in this PDF.

To summarize, we found very efficient results using a simple neural network with 3 hidden layers and sigmoid activation functions.
We minimized our cross-entropy using gradient descent, and presented our results by checking training and test non-validation error and bit error rate.
